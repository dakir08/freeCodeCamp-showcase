            John von Neumann was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist,
            computer scientist, and polymath. Von Neumann was generally regarded
            as the foremost mathematician of his time and said to be "the last
            representative of the great mathematicians". a genius who was
            comfortable integrating both pure and applied sciences.
          </p>
          <p>
            He made major contributions to a number of fields, including
            mathematics, physics, economics and statistics.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum
            mechanics in the development of functional analysis, and a key
            figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of
            cellular automata, the universal constructor and the digital
            computer.
